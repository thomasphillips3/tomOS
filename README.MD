# tomOS

**tomOS** is a simple operating system simulation project built in Python as part of a structured, hands-on course. This repository will be updated with each lesson to gradually expand and enhance the OS simulation.

## Lesson 1: Kernel Basics
- A basic kernel loop that accepts user commands.
- Implemented commands include `help` and `exit`.
- The kernel prints a unique welcome message: "What up doe!" along with introductory texts.

## Future Lessons
Upcoming topics will include:
- Process Management & Scheduling
- Memory Management Simulation
- Virtual File System Implementation
- Inter-Process Communication (IPC) & Device Simulation

Each lesson will build on the previous one, so check back frequently for updates and improvements.

## Running tomOS
To run the kernel simulation, execute:

```bash
python tomos.py
